# Foundational Python Scripts for Raspberry Pi and GPIO Learning 

## Project Summary

This repository is a collection of Python scripts and examples developed during a Bachelor of Science (BSc) module on Embedded Systems and Physical Computing. It serves as a comprehensive portfolio of foundational codes used for hands-on learning, testing various physical components, and mastering the Raspberry Pi's General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) interface and basic peripheral communication. These codes represent multiple exercises covering sensor integration, data logging, and low-level hardware control.

## Embedded Systems & Python Focus 

This coursework portfolio demonstrates mastery over core concepts in embedded systems programming and Python for physical computing:

* Physical Computing Mastery: Covered fundamental techniques for reading digital and analog inputs and controlling outputs using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins, including basic timing and event-driven programming.

* Sensor Interfacing Modules: Explored and implemented scripts to interface with various types of sensors, focusing on data acquisition principles and signal conditioning.

* Low-Level Libraries: Utilized and gained proficiency in dedicated Python libraries (e.g., RPi.GPIO, Adafruit_DHT, or similar) essential for interacting directly with hardware components and device drivers.

* Conceptual Application: Applied core programming concepts to solve specific hardware challenges, ranging from blinking LEDs to setting up serial communication.

## Technical Scope & Components 

The project relies exclusively on Python for all computational and control tasks related to the Raspberry Pi:

* Hardware Platform: Raspberry Pi (e.g., Model 3B/4)

* Primary Language: Python 3.x

* Interface Concepts: GPIO pins, basic I2C/SPI communication protocols.

* Learning Modules: Sensor integration (e.g., Temperature, Humidity), I/O control (LEDs, relays), and basic data serialization.

* Data Handling: Simple data logging to console or flat-file (CSV/JSON) formats for immediate analysis.

* Core Libraries: RPi.GPIO, time, board, and relevant driver libraries.

## Key Professional Learnings 

* Practical Embedded Development: Gained hands-on experience in the essential tasks of physical computing and controlling micro-hardware.

* Modular Problem Solving: Developed the ability to structure code into reusable modules, adapting scripts for different sensor and peripheral requirements.

* Hardware-Software Debugging: Acquired critical skills in diagnosing and resolving integration issues between physical hardware and Python software.
