# Foundational Python Scripts for Raspberry Pi and GPIO Learning 

## Repository Summary

This repository is a collection of Python scripts and examples developed during a Bachelors module on Internet of Things. It serves as a comprehensive portfolio of foundational codes used for hands-on learning, testing various physical components, and mastering the Raspberry Pi's General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) interface and basic peripheral communication. These codes represent multiple exercises covering sensor integration, data logging, and low-level hardware control.

## Embedded Systems & Python Focus 

This coursework portfolio demonstrates mastery over core concepts in embedded systems programming and Python for physical computing:

* Covered fundamental techniques for reading digital and analog inputs and controlling outputs using the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins, including basic timing and event-driven programming.

* Explored and implemented scripts to interface with various types of sensors, focusing on data acquisition principles and signal conditioning.

* Applied core programming concepts to solve specific hardware challenges, ranging from blinking LEDs to setting up serial communication.

## Technical Scope & Components 

The project relies exclusively on Python for all computational and control tasks related to the Raspberry Pi:

* Hardware Platform: Raspberry Pi 

* Primary Language: Python 3

* Learning Modules: Sensor integration, I/O control, and basic data serialization.

* Data Handling: Simple data logging to console.
